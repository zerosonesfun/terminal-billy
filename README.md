# terminal-billy

A command line interface for any website that anyone with very basic website coding knowledge can get up and running and customize quickly and easily.

[Demo](https://zerosonesfun.github.io/terminal-billy/terminal.html)

(The email command won't fully work in the demo, or your version at this time. See notes section below.)

## Mission
1. Create a fun and nerdy way to interact with websites.
2. Keep it as simple as adding a hamburger menu to a website. Beginner webmasters should be able to copy/paste the code and have a version up and running quickly.

---

## Installation
1. Copy the code in terminal.html and paste it where you want it.
2. If pasting into an existing page you may delete from `<html>` to `<body>` and delete `</body>` and `</html>` at the end.
3. Replace response verbiage you see throughout with your own.

In the future a generator will be built so one can more quickly have a custom terminal without much thought.
